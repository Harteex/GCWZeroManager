ÄNDRA HUR CONNECTIONS FUNKAR? ha alltid anslutningen igång??

* Disconnect on man byter active connection!

* First time you click on Add OPKs or upload file, inform about dragndrop
* Ny system info ikon... alla nya från kde???
* tooltip på toolbaren i files!
* Sortera mapparna längst upp alltid på name...

NYTT:
* Krashar om man försöker överföra filer som flyttats / tagits bort
* Vi borde spara när man ändrar inställningar direkt, inte bara på avslut!

Backup:
another useful option would be a backup feature that would rsync all the dot-directories under $HOME

(02:16:04) (Harteex) mth, maybe it would be useful to have an option in the gcw zero manager in the future to collect system information, and it would run a number of commands to get valuable information
(02:16:20) (Harteex) regarding the problem in #gcw
(02:16:41) (pcercuei) Harteex: your manager can SSH, right?
(02:16:45) (Harteex) yes
(02:16:58) (pcercuei) if it installs a key, then you have full access to the commands
(02:17:02) (Harteex) yep
(02:17:22) (mth) Harteex: yes, that would be very useful
(02:17:35) (mth) dmesg would be good to have
(02:17:43) (pcercuei) ssh opendingux.local /usr/bin/system_info
(02:17:56) (mth) also, checking the kernel and rootfs sha1 and comparing that to the on-device .sha1 files
(02:18:16) (mth) battery level

* Background image in datagrid which says dragndrop or something, should only show up when empty... also centered, not repeated.
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13509902/turning-a-wpf-datagrid-background-image-on-and-off
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3100837/how-to-set-background-image-on-grid-in-wpf-using-c-sharp
* Read title from OPKs
  Port libopk? https://github.com/gcwnow/libopk
* Make it possible to uninstall apps
  - Use ssh and opkinfo or similar to find titles etc
* System update should show current installed version
* Make ssh work with passwords... make config app for that on the zero?
* Sort datagrids on titles?
* Show errors better such as connection failed etc
* Info screen with credits and license for icons etc
* Default key browse dir in appdata
* Testa ordentligt när man tar setup keys och det... ändra guiden lite för den knappen???
  - eller ta bort setup keys.. om man vill setupa keys så så får man helt enkelt skapa en ny??
  - förifyllda värden duger nog.. <--- TESTA!!!



SSH: bättre alternativ? http://sshnet.codeplex.com/

SSDP:
(00:56:49) (mth) Harteex: passwords is possible; xl0 got something working and then we found a cleaner way but that wasn't implemented yet
(00:56:54) (mth) I can look up the logs and finish it
(00:57:37) (Harteex) cool
(00:59:22) (Harteex) That would also make it easier for me to do the OPK installer thingy GCW-2013 wanted
(01:00:07) (zear) mth, you never got xl0's otg code/patches, did you?
(01:04:56) (mth) only part of them, and those I integrated a few weeks ago
(01:06:20) (mth) Harteex: I do think it's best if an installer would generate a private key and add the public key on the device's authorized keys list
(01:06:27) (mth) but you need one successful login to be able to do that
(01:07:04) (mth) that approach would avoid saving passwords
(01:07:20) (mth) and it would allow a password reset without having to re-setup the installer
(01:08:50) (Harteex) yea that could probably be done
(01:08:57) (Harteex) if I'm able to connect with a password the first time
(01:09:00) (mth) FTP via USB has no password, so you could use that for the key exchange the first time
(01:09:45) (Harteex) yes, I just thought it would be much easier for the users if they didn't have to deal with any potential usb networking issues
(01:10:41) (mth) depends on the OS; Linux and OS X and certain versions of Windows are fine, but other versions of Windows are a pain
(01:10:56) (Harteex) yea
(01:11:08) (Harteex) and especially since this is supposed to be a windows tool
(01:11:22) (mth) please make it cross platform
(01:11:46) (mth) some OS X users would like a transfer application as well
(01:11:49) (Harteex) justin said he wanted a windows tool and that someone else made an OSX one I think, but this was a long time ago
(01:12:13) (mth) I don't think it really make sense to have separate applications
(01:12:19) (Harteex) yea
(01:12:21) (mth) what language / toolkit did you plan to use?
(01:12:33) (Harteex) I've already started, I'm using .net
(01:12:47) (Harteex) but Mono should run fine on OSX I assume
(01:13:01) (mth) depends on which APIs you use; it could run fine
(01:13:05) (Harteex) I'll have to see if it works ok with WPF
(01:13:43) (mth) I just finished the remake of Larry and that was written in Unity and ran reasonably well (there were bugs but Windows users reported the same bugs)
(01:14:28) (mth) note that for WiFi you'd have to enter both the password and the IP address
(01:15:19) (mth) unless you're using bonjour / zeroconf / DNS-SD, but that's not straightforward under Windows afaik
(01:15:42) (Harteex) yea
(01:16:31) (Harteex) would it be possible otherwise to include if I make a very small application that just listens on a standard UDP request? so I can broadcast and find the device?
(01:19:22) (mth) on the Zero's side, no problem
(01:19:41) (mth) are UDP broadcasts allowed if you have no privileges on Windows?
(01:19:48) (Harteex) hmmm
(01:19:51) (mth) for ports > 1024 maybe
(01:20:09) (mth) some types of broadcasts are certainly restricted
(01:20:21) (mth) and some users don't run as admin
(01:20:29) (Harteex) yes, I will have to look that up
(01:20:44) (mth) plus there is the question of what the default firewall settings are
(01:20:52) (Harteex) but if that works, it will be a very easy way to identify the device on a network regardless of platform
(01:21:08) (Harteex) ah true.. that too
(01:21:16) (Harteex) how annoying..
(01:21:23) (mth) DNS-SD was designed for this
(01:21:31) (mth) but MS decided to go with UPNP instead
(01:21:40) (mth) maybe you can do UPNP on the Zero
(01:22:00) (Harteex) possibly
(01:22:35) (mth) this is what MS supports: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol
(01:22:35) (Harteex) I could look into that
(01:22:57) (mth) the chance of firewalls blocking that is smaller
(01:23:04) (Harteex) yep
(01:23:48) (mth) we've already got avahi running on the Zero, so the "beacon" application could use both avahi and SSDP to make itself known
(01:24:01) (Harteex) yes
(01:24:16) (mth) actually, avahi is always running, so the user wouldn't have to start the application for that
(01:24:22) (Harteex) btw, samba is still planned to include right?
(01:24:34) (mth) yes, it's something I'm looking at
(01:24:45) (mth) I had it running once, but it was really slow
(01:24:54) (mth) so it will certainly work, but may not be ideal
(01:25:07) (mth) WebDAV is another possibility
(01:25:09) (Harteex) I could do some simple configuration GUI for that when it's up and running, because users probably want to be able to turn it on and off and set passwords etc
(01:25:14) (mth) but that is less discoverable, I think
(01:25:18) (Harteex) ah k
(01:25:35) (johnnyonflame) Harteex, if you do something with SSDP please comment it throughly so I can steal your work
(01:25:40) (Harteex) lol
(01:25:56) (Harteex) I don't believe in comments ;) j/k
